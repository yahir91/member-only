# Micro-reddit

> In this project, we’ll be working to implement an authentication system so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to. The app is an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Logged in members can see who the author of a post is but and non members can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. including:

-Models
-Controllers
-Migrations
-Views
-Authentications

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6
- Ruby in Rails 5
- Git Flow
- SQL Lite 3
- DEVISE
